I wish Kentucky basketball had won the NCAA March Madness Tournament this year.
I played with a player from their team, Devin Booker.
Kentucky had the talent to win the whole tournament this year,
but they lacked in experience since most of their team were 1st year players.
They will lose many players to the draft this year.

They will still be good next year!
